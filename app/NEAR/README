NEAR data files, provided by James Miller.

* ASTATT.BPC 

Is the Eros Attitude SPICE file. This trajectory is the final fit of NEAR data for the 35 km orbit in the summer of 2000.  It starts on July 3, 2000 and runs for about 30 days.


* ASTEPH.BSP 

Is the Eros Ephemeris SPICE file. This trajectory is the final fit of NEAR data for the 35 km orbit in the summer of 2000.  It starts on July 3, 2000 and runs for about 30 days.



* gr_069.dat  

A gravity file (same format as gre_004) obtained by integrating the shape model


* GRE_004.dat   

A gravity file determined from radiometric and optical data that represents the best gravity field I have.

The format is
                         degree    flag1   flag2
                         volume, density,mass                Km^3,specific gravity, Kg
