- [TBB] use the cache_aligned_allocator wherever possible;
- implement "roving observer": http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/info/RovingObs.html
- weighted stats in orbit determination;
- handle radar observations;
- solar pressure, for satellites, and atmosphere drag;
- remember to always initialize osg::Reference using Reference(true) in the library, that makes sure all works fine when the library is used in multi-thread programs;
- think about finding a way to compile orsa software for condor: are threads really needed? where am I getting that, from Qt4?
- consider using cmake instead of qmake;
- write a test suite, to quickly check code correctness while developing;
- in ConstantInertialBodyProperty, derive the Inertia matrix from the PaulMoment, and drop inertia matrix from the arguments;
- remove EllipsoidShape, it's hard to rotate/offset as it is coded now; replace with code to generate an ellipsoid using triangles;
- try to use "const orsa::BodyGroup *"; 
- try CGAL library: http://www.cgal.org/
